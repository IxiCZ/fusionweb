		This application demonstrates the utilization of Complex Event Processing within the scope of web applications.
		It percives the action users perform as the events. The events are then processed by means of rule engine with event
		processing capabilities. When the rules are triggered, they generate appropriate response such as notification, statistics or layout change. 
		The events can also be viewed as assembled units which can be used as monitoring of users logged in.
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<h:outputText value="Roles" styleClass="aboutheader" />
		<br />
		<br />
		The application can be browsed as one of the following roles: 
		<h:outputText value="anonymous user" styleClass="italic" />, 
		<h:outputText value="customer" styleClass="italic" /> and 
		<h:outputText value="administrator" styleClass="italic" />. 
		For the easier use, the direct logging links are displayed in the right corner.<br />
		<br />
		<div align="center">

		</div>
		<br />
		With the use of common Log in link, there are three customers that can be applied (username/password): rick/1234, will/1234/, frodo/1234 and one adiminstrator: hugo/1234.
		Apart from that, new customer can be registered via Register link. 
		<br />
		<br />
		Any user can search,browse or view the products and add them to the shopping cart. However only a customer can perform the checkout and create the order.
		Administers can manage the content in a standard way, such as product, or orders administration. Furthermore then can utilize the event processing capabilities. 
		Relevant menu items can be found in the Administration menu (logging in as administrator is required).

		<br />
		<br />
		As events meets a defined state, rules consequence is executed and notification can be created.
		 Notifications in the picture below are the ones created not more than once ha hour. 
		 You can easily try the situation by registrating 3 times within an hour, or making an order - 
		 by modyfing the number of items in the shopping cart across one or multiple orders
		  - for more than 100 products (these numbers are established in rules and are just demonstratory,
		 real number would originated in application analysis).
